# 📊 Gaurav Agarwal — Data & Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my Data & Analytics portfolio!  
This repository showcases my **Python projects** and learning journey as I build hands-on skills in analytics, programming, and data handling.  

My **Excel-based financial and analytical projects** are available on Google Drive (link below).

## 🧠 About Me

Hi, I'm **Gaurav Agarwal** — a commerce student passionate about combining financial logic with data-driven problem solving.  
I’ve always enjoyed working with computers — from building QBasic quizzes in school to creating Excel models that simplify real-world financial decisions.  

This repository captures my Python learning journey through projects from:
- **100 Days with Python (Udemy)** — applied programming exercises
- **CFA Level 1 – Python Fundamentals** — finance-oriented analytics
- **SEC Folder** — my earliest experiments with Python basics and logic
